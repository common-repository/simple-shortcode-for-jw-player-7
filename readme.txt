Plugin for JW player 7 that is compatible with the basic shortcodes from JW player 6 plugin

== Description ==

Plugin for JW player 7 that is compatible with the basic shortcodes from JW player 6 plugin.

This plugin works with the self-hosted version of JW Player. To get it, you need to sign up on https://www.jwplayer.com.


= Shortcode =
[jwplayer]

This is a list of mostly self explanatory attributes for the shortcode / video player.

* width
* height
* image
* file
* title
* description
* ratio
* mediaid
* controls
* autostart

mediaid is the wordpress id of a file you have uploaded in the media library. If this is set, the plugin will get the title, description and thumbnail from that file, not from the shortcode.

If you set for instance: [jwplayer width="100%" ratio="16:9"], then the video will be responsive.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/jw-player-7` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. A new menu item should appear named 'Stores'
